# Battle Sim 2
This game is a simple text-based battle simulator that runs in the terminal, I used it for my final project in AP Comp Sci Principles. This version is slightly updated from the one I submitted. The previous game I made was for my Python 1 final, where I was much less experienced.

# Vision
I want to make the game modular, with each function in a different file allowing people to learn about programing by changeing the code and seeing what happens. I also plan to creat a website at some point to have lessons that go through the instilation in-depth, how the files are structured, and what each function does.

## Instalation
You can install with pip or pipx, or any other method for installing python packages from GitHub repos.
pip example:
```terminal
pip install git+https://github.com/GDSM8CZY/BattleSim2.git
```
pipx example:
```terminal
pipx install git+https://github.com/GDSM8CZY/BattleSim2.git
```
Then to play type in terminal
```terminal
battlesim2
```
