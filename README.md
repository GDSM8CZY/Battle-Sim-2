# Battle Sim 2
This game is a simple text based battle simulator that runs in the terminal, I used it for my final project in AP Comp Sci Priciples. This version is slightly updated from the one I submitted. The previous game was one I made was for my python 1 final, where I was much less expirienced.

## New Gameplay
- There are many new weapons
- You select a name for yourself and the enemy
- Player stats are saved in a spererate file based on name
- Added ASCII art from [https://www.asciiart.eu/]

## Code Changes
- Instead of classes for each weapon, there is now a 'Weapon' class
- Instead of a seperate class for the player and the enemy, there is now a 'Figher' class
- Classes now have an init() method and other methods in the classes
